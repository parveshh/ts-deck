TypeScript Basics & Beyond

---
## A little word on what this talk is about
<p style={{padding:"0px 300px"}}>
This talk covers some of the advantanges of using TypeScript and also demonstrates how developers can get enhanced
development experience when using TypeScript, your code however be it in TypeScript or Javascript, should always be
properly backed by unit testing and where-ever applicable with integration and end-to-end tests.

TypeScript is not about developing bugfree, but it enhances the development experience by highligting some possible code issues and providing
some intelligent features
</p>

## What is TypeScript
<p style={{padding:"0px 300px"}}>
Its an OpenSource compile to JavaScript language, it works by adding static and computed type definitions on top of JavaScript,
any valid JavaScript is also a valid TypeScript

- Developed by __Anders Hejlsberg__ (also created C# , Delphi and Turbo Pascal)

- First version was release in October 2012

- Open Sourced in 2014 (although code was avalable in 2012 but one could not contribute)

```js title="this JavaScript"

  function Multiply(a,b){
    return a * b;
  }

```

```ts title="becomes this TypeScript"

  function Multiply(a:number,b:number): number{
    return a * b;
  }

```

</CodeSurfer>

<CodeSurferColumns themes={{vsDark, github}}>

<Step>

```ts subtitle="TypeScript"

  function Multiply(a:number, b:number): number {
    return a * b;
  }

```

_function Multiply_ accepts 2 parameters, both __numbers__ and returns a __number__

</Step>

# What is a type?
<p style={{padding:"0px 300px"}}>

- a _type_ is metadata for a declared variable/attribute and it tells the compiler to treat as such
    - number, boolean, string etc.

- a type also narrows down on what could be assigned to that variable, like a _string_ cannot be assigned to _number_

    Airbnb migrated their codebase to TypeScript in 2019, when they tried to replicate the bugs
    they had encountered previously, they found out that 38% of those bugs could be mitigated
    just by TypeScript conversion

  An independant study has found that 15% of the bugs in famous OpenSource repositories were easily
  found out by TypeScript conversion.

# Lets start with some types

---

## Basic types and some special ones

In TypeScript _null_ and _undefined_ are also treates as a __type__ and it introduces
some new types _any_, _unknown_ and _never_

---

## Complex, Optional and Enum Types

A type with mutiple properties is referred as _complex type_ here, any type can have Optional
properties  which is marked by _?_

A type can be declared as a literal as well


---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="Optional & Literal types"

export type DebitCard = {
  cardNumber: string;
  cardExpiry?: string; // optional type
  cardType: "Debit";  // this is a  literal type
  cancelled: boolean;
};


```

</CodeSurfer>

# Intesection, Literal, Union & Discriminated Union types

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="Index Types"
type Vehicle = {
  make: string
  model: string
  year?: string

}

type UserVehicles = {
  [key: string] : Vehicle
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="keyOf"

type Vehicle = {
  make: string
  model: string
  year?: string

}

type VehicleProps = keyOf Vehicle;
// "make" | "model" | "year"

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="Mapped types"

type Vehicle = {
  make: string
  model: string
  year?: string

}

// Mapped
type Required<T> = {[P in keyOf T]-?: T[P]}


```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="Template Literals"

type Fade = "fade"
type InOut = "In" | "Out"

// Template Literal
type Animation = `${Fade}${InOut}`

// fadeIn | fadeOut


```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="infer keyword"

type ComponentType<T> = T extends (args: infer arg)=> infer _Result ? arg : never;


```
